  <h3>Dear Srishti,</h3>
  <img src="IMG_8343.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
  <p>Happy 17th birthday! I took this photo of the cabinet in my art class and knew that I would end up using it. You show up everywhere in my life, not just in our interactions but in the little things. The cabinet full of rulers, the purple pen that I grab at random out of my bag, whenever someone mentions the movie Oppenheimer (a very good movie). Whenever I see monkey, or a dolphin, or a guy in a bear costume. Whenever I missspell a word and accidentally write about collages. No matter what happens, I hope you stay in my life, and I want to stay in yours. I need the "Srishti Voice" in my head telling me that I'm not slick (even if its never true). Moreover, I need the openness we've developed with each other. I haven't been the best at it, but I feel you've allowed me to become vulnerable more than anyone else. Last thing: whenever I see a word that changed meaning between us, I'm reminded of our friendship. For example, moth, cracked, hmm... there was another word that changed meanings, what was it? Anyways, I hope you enjoy your birthday becuase</p>
  <h1>Today, you are the ruler!</h1>
  <p>Love,</p>
  <h2>Adam</h2>
