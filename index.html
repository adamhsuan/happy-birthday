  <h3>Dear Srishti,</h3>
  <img src="IMG_8343.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
  <p>Happy 17th birthday! It already passed but I want to celebrate it here nonetheless. I really hope you enjoyed it, after all, you were the ruler of the day (sorry). I hope you know that you show up everywhere in my life, not just in our interactions but in so many little things. The cabinet full of rulers that I unfortunately stumbled upon in my art class and had to take a picture of, the purple pen that I grab at random out of my bag, whenever someone mentions the movie Oppenheimer (a very good movie). Whenever I see monkey, or a dolphin, or a cricket, or a moth, or a lion, a guy in a bear costume, or a hippo, or a praying mantis, or... yea basically every animal. Whenever I missspell a word and accidentally write about collages. When I look up at the clouds during a workout (not stalling), or when I peel a bannana (the right way). I cut my lip shaving right before writing this and the first thing that came to mind was you telling me how often I come to school with a cut on my face from shaving. It doesn't even matter what I'm doing. Even when I'm doing nothing you still show up, and every time you do you make my day. No matter what happens, I hope we stick together, and through it all, I know we have it in us. I need the "Srishti Voice" in my head telling me that I'm not slick (even if its never true). More importantly, I need the openness we've developed with each other. I haven't been the best at it, but I feel you've allowed me to become vulnerable more than anyone else. </p>
  <h1></h1>
  <p> Also, I've attatched your slick file: </p>
