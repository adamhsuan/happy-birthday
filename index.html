  <h3>Dear Srishti,</h3>
  <img src="IMG_8343.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
  <p>Happy 17th birthday! I hope you know that you show up everywhere in my life, not just in our interactions but in so many little things. The cabinet full of rulers that I unfortunately stumbled upon in my art class and had to take a picture of, the purple pen that I grab at random out of my bag, whenever someone mentions the movie Oppenheimer (a very good movie). Whenever I see monkey, or a dolphin, or a guy in a bear costume. Whenever I missspell a word and accidentally write about collages. It doesn't even matter what I'm doing. Even when I'm doing nothing you still show up, and every time you do you make my day. No matter what happens, I hope we stick together. Through it all, I know we have it in us. I need the "Srishti Voice" in my head telling me that I'm not slick (even if its never true). More importantly, I need the openness we've developed with each other. I haven't been the best at it, but I feel you've allowed me to become vulnerable more than anyone else. Last thing: whenever I see a word that changed meaning between us, I'm reminded of our friendship. For example, moth, cracked, hmm... there was another word that changed meanings, what was it? Anyways, I hope you enjoy your birthday becuase</p>
  <h1>Today, you are the ruler!</h1>
  <p>Love,</p>
  <h2>Adam</h2>
