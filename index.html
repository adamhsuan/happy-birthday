  <h3>Dear Srishti,</h3>
  <img src="IMG_8343.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
  <p>Happy 17th birthday Srishti! I took this photo of the cabinet in my art class, and knew that I would end up using it. You show up everywhere in my life, not just in our interactions but in the little things. The cabinet full of rulers, the purple pen that I grab at random out of my bag, whenever someone mentions the movie oppenheimer (a very good movie). No matter what happens, I hope you stay in my life, and I want to stay in yours. I need the "Srishti Voice" in my head telling me that I'm not slick (even if its never true). I hope you enjoy your birthday, becuase </p>
  <h1>Today, you are the ruler!</h1>
  <p>Love,</p>
  <h2>Aditya</h2>
